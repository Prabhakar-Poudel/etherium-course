# Etherium Solidity appliction with Next.js

This application was developed aa a part of cource I took with [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/).

The application allows peope to create contract for croud funding.  
One can donate to campaigns.  
The owner of the contract can ask approvals for payments on the contract.  
The doners can approve a request.  
And the contract creator can finalize requests.

### Build guide

To test the application locally run `npm run dev` and go to `localhost:3000`.
